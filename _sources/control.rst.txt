Control
*************

We separate the controller objects from the system objects, so that we could develop general control framework for different model and systems using the same interface. 

All control classes are inherited from the abstract super-class Controller_, which provides general interfaces to all controllers.

Controller_ class has two required properties:

- Name: the name of the controller
- Param: the parameter of the controller

In addition, it must provides a function to compute the control input with the syntax:

.. code-block:: matlab

   >> [u, extra] = obj.calcControl(t, q, dq, vfc, gfc, domain)
..




.. attention:: The implementation of these classes can be found in the folder ``frost-dev/matlab/control``.
