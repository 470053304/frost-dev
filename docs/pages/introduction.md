## Overview

FROST (**F**ast **R**obot **O**ptimization and **S**imulation **T**oolkit) an
open-source MATLAB toolkit developed
by [AMBER Lab](https://http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/) for dynamical system
modeling, trajectory optimization and model-based control design of robotic
systems, with a special focus in dynamic locomotion whose dynamics is hybrid in
nature. The design objective of FROST is to provide a unified software
environment for developing model based control and motion planning algorithms
based on [Hybrid Zero Dynamics](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/faculty/grizzle/web-book.html)
framework for robotic systems. In particular, FROST uses directed graphs to
describe the underlying discrete structure of hybrid system models, which
renders it capable of representing a wide variety of robotic systems. Equipped
with a custom symbolic math toolbox in MATLAB using Wolfram Mathematica, one can
rapidly prototype the mathematical model of robot kinematics and dynamics and
generate optimized code of symbolic expressions to boost the speed of
optimization and simulation in FROST. In favor of agile and dynamic behaviors,
we utilize virtual constraint based motion planning and feedback controllers for
robotic systems to exploit the full-order dynamics of the model. Moreover, FROST
provides a fast and tractable framework for planning optimal trajectories of
hybrid dynamical systems using advanced direct collocation algorithms.
